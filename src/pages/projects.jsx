                Here's a curated list of projects I'm involved with. Some of them are
                full on public-facing services. Some of them are school projects I'm
                proud of. Some of them are just an excuse for me to explore a new
                technology. Regardless, I try to package them in a shareable way, and I
                hope you can have some fun poking around.
